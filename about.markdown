I am 23 and I was born and raised in San Mateo, California. I am currently a Developer Advocate at Alluxio and I've been here for 2 years! Before that, I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a certificate from the Technology Management Program. I had never heard of Community Evangelist or Developer Advocate before joining Alluxio, but I've really enjoyed the role ever since.
